The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you have spaces around the operators, it may result in unexpected behavior or parse errors. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works correctly, but `width: calc( 100% - 20px );` may not.  Another issue can occur with the use of units within `calc()`, especially when combining percentages and pixels. For example,  `height: calc(50% + 100px)` might not render as expected in all browsers if the container's height is smaller than the calculated value.
